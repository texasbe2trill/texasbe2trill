## <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Profile-About-000000?style=flat-square&logo=github" />
I work in security incident response, analyzing how attackers interact with real systems and applying machine learning techniques to help surface meaningful signals during investigations.

My day-to-day work is about understanding incidents in context — how systems failed, how attackers operated, and which signals actually mattered under real operational constraints.

Things I currently focus on:
- Security architecture, threat modeling, and risk analysis
- Incident response and adversary simulation
- Reliability, observability, and operational visibility in production systems
- Applied ML and NLP for security analysis and triage

### <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-AlertSage-3776AB?style=flat-square&logo=python&logoColor=white" />
**Python / Jupyter-based NLP project for security alert triage**

- Exploratory and applied NLP using Python and Jupyter notebooks  
- Focused on text classification, feature extraction, and **systematic model evaluation**  
- Designed to support analyst judgment rather than automate conclusions  
- Emphasizes transparency, reproducibility, and measurable signal quality

### <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-Constellation%20Engine-3776AB?style=flat-square&logo=python&logoColor=white" />
**Deterministic dependency reasoning engine for distributed systems**

- Models service architectures as explicit dependency graphs  
- Identifies failure blast radius and critical services before incidents occur  
- Makes hidden coupling and cascading failure paths explicit  
- Focuses on deterministic, reproducible reasoning over probabilistic scoring  

This project reflects how I approach incident response at the system level:  
understanding **structure**, **dependencies**, and **what actually breaks when something fails**.

### <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-ShodanR-276DC3?style=flat-square&logo=r&logoColor=white" />
**R package for analyzing internet-exposed services using Shodan**

- Programmatic access to Shodan data for exposure analysis and research  
- Supports enrichment, aggregation, and reproducible reporting  
- Useful for threat research, attack-surface analysis, and analytics workflows

### <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-hooplyticsR-6f42c1?style=flat-square&logo=r&logoColor=white" />
**Data analysis and modeling project using R**

- Data ingestion, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis  
- Demonstrates statistical reasoning and reproducible research practices  
- Separate from security work, but representative of analytical rigor

## <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Philosophy-How%20I%20Build-444444?style=flat-square" />
I approach security and AI work with a focus on:
- **Evidence over assumptions** — models and controls should be testable and measurable  
- **Engineer partnership** — security should enable delivery, not obstruct it  
- **Operational realism** — designs must hold up under incident conditions  
- **Simplicity at scale** — the best solutions are understandable and maintainable

I’m currently focused on:
- Applying ML and NLP to real security workflows  
- Improving incident response through better analysis and tooling  
- Building systems that balance **security, reliability, and developer experience**
